# Sorting Algorithms & Big O

This project introduces the fundamentals of sorting algorithms and time complexity analysis using Big O notation.

## Concepts Covered

- **Sorting algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
- **Time complexity (Big O)**: How algorithm performance scales with input size.
- **Common complexities**: O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n²), O(2ⁿ).
- **How to choose a sorting algorithm**:
  - Small or nearly sorted input → Insertion Sort
  - Large input → Merge Sort / Quick Sort / Heap Sort
  - Need stability → Merge Sort / Insertion Sort
- **Stable vs unstable sorting**:
  - Stable → equal elements keep original order
  - Unstable → order may change

## Goal

Understand how sorting algorithms work, compare their execution costs, and analyze their efficiency using Big O notation.
